# SELF-BLM

SELF-BLM is constructed for prediction of drug-target interactions.

This method is based on bipartite local model (BLM) which is developed by Beeakely et al.

To train the model, LIBSVM (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) should be installed.

The details are expalined in the main source code file comments.

####training datasets

drug and target similarity matrices and these interaction previous datasets of each protein types. 
these datasets are taken by Yamanishi et al.
these datasets are also avaliable at the following URL http://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~yyamanishi/bipartitelocal/

####updated datsets

updated interaction datasets for validation of each protein types. The update date is January 2016.
