# SELF-BLM

SELF-BLM is constructed for prediction of drug-target interactions

training datasets: drug and target similarity matrices and these interaction previous datasets of each protein types
these datasets are taken by Yamanishi et al.
avaliable at the following URL http://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~yyamanishi/bipartitelocal/

updated datsets: updated interaction datasets for validation of each protein types.
